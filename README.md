# rflow - Pipeline Interface for TensorFlow in R
This is an experimental and work-in-progress R library for easily using Google TensorFlow, inspired by Google [skflow](https://github.com/google/skflow) package. This package aims to help R users to easily build popular deep learning models as well as customized models with flexible and desired deep architectures. Note that the style of the way the package has been developed is new and experimental. Any feedback would be appreciated.
